Isolated environment for JUST component development.
The Component.jsx file is under .gitignore so you must create it
and write the following code to run it.

```
import React from 'react';

class Component extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>Hello World!</div>
    );
  }
}

export default Component;

```
